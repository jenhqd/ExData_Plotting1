R files 'plot1.R', 'plot2.R', 'plot3.R', 'plot4.R' contain the code to download the dataset as txt,
processing the data, and  generate the corresponding plots as png files.

plot1.R provides two methods to achieve the data for plotting:
1) Reading the whole data set then subsetting
2) Reading only rows that satisfy the conditions (only two required days) using readr packages
